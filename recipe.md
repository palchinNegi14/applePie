After everything is properly mixed, add butter.
Make sure the butter is cold and that it stays cold throughout the mixing process.
Knead the butter until it becomes like a powder again.
Then, take some iced water and add it to the powder so that it can become a dough.
once it becomes like a proper dough, cover it in cellophane sheet and put it in the fridge to cool for 30 mins.
THE FILLING-
Skin the apple and cut it into fine pieces in a bowl.
Add some flour, powdered sugar and the some cinnamon.(you candecide the quantity you want to add)
AFTER 30 MINS-
Take the dough out of the fridge.
